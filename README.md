Blog Source forked from StrayBirds
===

This is my blog source forked from [StrayBirds](https://github.com/minixalpha/StrayBirds)

Since I read [this article](http://blog.csdn.net/on_1y/article/details/19259435), I began to create
my blog with jekyll in github pages, and I've made some progress. You may click 
[here](https://baiwfg2.github.io) to see.

More changes will be customized later. Anyway, thanks for StrayBirds's creator.
